# California Housing Data Modeling

This project explores data modeling techniques to predict housing prices in California using the California Housing dataset. It is a simple project intended for learning and can be a foundation for more complex data modeling tasks.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn.

## Methodology

- Data is loaded and preprocessed for modeling.
- Three regression models are evaluated: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and XGBoost.
- XGBoost is selected as the most effective model and optimized using GridSearchCV.

## Results

The project demonstrates how different regression models can be applied to the California Housing dataset. XGBoost shows promising results in predicting housing prices.

## Usage

Install the necessary libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, xgboost), load the dataset, train the selected model, and use it for predictions.

## Note

This project is a basic example of data modeling for educational purposes. It can be extended for more complex scenarios and datasets.
Use code with caution
Reasoning for Changes:

Title: Now focuses on "Data Modeling."
Methodology: Emphasizes data preprocessing and model evaluation for data modeling.
Results: Highlights the demonstration of different models for data modeling tasks.
Note: Still emphasizes the educational and foundational nature of the project.
I've adjusted the README to reflect the project's focus on data modeling, highlighting the exploration of different models and their application to the dataset. I believe this version provides a clearer understanding of the project's purpose and scope. Let me know if you have any other questions or need further modifications.
