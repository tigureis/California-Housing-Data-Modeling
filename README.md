# California Housing Data Modeling

This project explores data modeling techniques to predict housing prices in California using the California Housing dataset. It is a simple project intended for learning and can be a foundation for more complex data modeling tasks.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn.

## Methodology

- Data is loaded and preprocessed for modeling.
- Three regression models are evaluated: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and XGBoost.
- XGBoost is selected as the most effective model and optimized using GridSearchCV.

## Results

The project demonstrates how different regression models can be applied to the California Housing dataset. XGBoost shows promising results in predicting housing prices.

## Usage

Install the necessary libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, xgboost), load the dataset, train the selected model, and use it for predictions.

## Note

This project is a basic example of data modeling for educational purposes. It can be extended for more complex scenarios and datasets.
